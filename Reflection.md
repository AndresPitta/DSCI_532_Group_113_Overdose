# DSCI_532_Group_113_Overdose

## Reflection

Overdash is a visualization app that is designed to provide insights into the rising deaths by accidental overdose in Connecticut from 2012 to 2019. It assists health professional, law enforcement professionals and policymaker by providing a visual representation of this crisis. 

In the forefront of the app, there is a line plot which shows the prevalence of accidental overdose in Connecticut by displaying the count of people died from accidental overdose from 2012 to 2018, the rising trend shows the motivation behind building this app. The user can filter the plot by choosing the race of the victim and the place where the victim was found dead.

The app then proceeds into two sections: " The Killer" section is where users interested in answering questions about the most lethal drugs. Two plots are provided here; a bar chart and a heat map. The bar chart is an effective choice here since it gives a fast glimpse into the ranking of the toxicity test results. The heatmap reflects toxicity tests results in which two drugs tested positive.

To assist the user to learn more about each specific drug, a brief description of the drug and its chemical structure is displayed. The combination of plots and information in this section helps the app user understand the connections between different drugs. These tools combined provide a powerful tool to the users concerned about the drugs involved in the overdose crisis.

In the second section, the users who are interested to know more about the victims themselves can use the plots to answer questions regarding the age, gender and race of the victims filtered by the drug. Hence, "The victims" section " allows the user to examine if there are any patterns in age/gender/race of the people who died in this crisis.

Given the time allotted to the design and the deployment of the app, it meets most of the aspects of expectations set in the proposal and exceeded them in some ways. However, as always there is room for improvement.  To start with, the layout of the app does not work well in narrower PC screens and screens of cell phone devices. That can be fixed by allowing the content to rearrange dynamically when the display screen changed. Also, the designer can make use of the many white spaces available between the plots and finally the size of titles of the charts and labels in the x-axis and y-xis in each plot can be improved.

## Responding to TA in Issue #25:

The app description in the README file was updated accordingly.  By filtering the race (age and gender filters were discarded) and places of deaths, users will be able to see the plot of death trend. While the age, gender and race distributions are generated with the selection of drugs. Also, we are setting a meeting early next week to specify the role of each member as requested.

How we addressed the feedback (GitHub issues) peers: 
Mainly through commenting in commits and pull requests.

## Responding to peer-review issues raised during the feedback session :


The feedback we received during the feedback session was mostly positive and in general, has lead to the improvement of the app in terms of usability and visualization tools contained. Easiness of using the app was the primary concern that was noted. The reviewers also advised the group to remove that the line plot since it is less effective than other the other plots in the app. Also, there were multiple comments about the inclusion of a link to the app in the repo readme file so has also been implemented.

One of the constructive comments as well that were the received was regarding the aesthetic of the plots such as making the plot titles consistent. According to that, we did several modifications as: adjust the angle of all the axis labels to make them consistent, remove the legends for gender and race plot as they are redundant and remove the "no description"s and "other"s from the gender plot as they did not provide much useful information.

There were some comments about reducing the heat map to half and change its colour; however, due to the time limitation, this was postponed for future implementation.


## TA comments on milestone 2 #42 :

Also, we are going to implement TA comments that mentioned in issue #42 . The following will be our actions points : 
- Extended description of the commits
- Comment on issues
- Add description of the app at the beginning
- Cite the data source
